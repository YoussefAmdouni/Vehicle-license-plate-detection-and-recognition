# Vehicle license plate detection and recognition

Vehicle License plate detection and recognition is a well-known challenge that has been tackled by many computer-vision labs and companies. But each country has its own lisence plate format in this case I tried to make a custom model for Tunisian lisence plate.
- Detection: we use yolov3 from darknet in order to train a custom license plate detection model.
- Recognition: we use optical character recognition to extract information


## Technologies:
- darknet, yolo
- Programming language: python
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib and OpenCV
